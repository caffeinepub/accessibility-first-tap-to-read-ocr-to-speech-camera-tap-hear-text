  "summary": "Diff adds a new `useCameraPermission` hook and updates `CameraPreview` and `CameraStartupFallback` toward improved permission-state handling, user-friendly messaging, and blank-preview/startup fallback handling. However, due to truncation of `CameraPreview.tsx`, several acceptance-criteria behaviors (timing, one-time restart limit, and screen-reader/status announcements for watchdog/fallback transitions) cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Announce an appropriate status update via the existing status announcement mechanism when the blank-preview watchdog triggers an automatic restart attempt, and ensure at most one automatic restart attempt.",
      "reason": "The diff shows state/refs suggesting a watchdog and single restart attempt (`blankPreviewTimeoutRef`, `hasAttemptedRestartRef`, `isVideoRendering`), but the truncated `CameraPreview.tsx` does not include the actual watchdog logic, the single-restart enforcement, or any `onStatusChange` calls tied to the watchdog/restart attempt.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/CameraPreview.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Ensure the manual 'Start Camera' fallback appears within 3 seconds when automatic startup fails silently after permission was granted, and provide screen-reader announcements reflecting transition into fallback and the result of tapping 'Start Camera'.",
      "reason": "`CameraPreview.tsx` includes refs that imply timeout-based fallback control (`startupTimeoutRef`, `hasShownFallbackRef`, `showFallback`), and `CameraStartupFallback` provides the UI/CTA, but the provided truncated snippet does not show the 3-second timing behavior nor any explicit announcements for entering the fallback state or after tapping Start Camera.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/CameraPreview.tsx",
        "frontend/src/components/CameraStartupFallback.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "If camera startup fails after permission is granted, show an actionable English error state (with Retry) instead of staying indefinitely on a loading screen.",
      "reason": "While `CameraPreview.tsx` clearly adds more user-friendly error mapping (including special handling when `permissionState === 'granted'`), the truncated diff does not show the final rendered error UI state, whether it includes a Retry action, or whether loading is prevented from persisting indefinitely after a post-grant failure.",
